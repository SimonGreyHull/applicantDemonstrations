    <h1>Loading Vertex Buffers onto the Graphics Card</h1>
    <p>This textbox contains a bunch of numbers. The programmer has
	to let the graphics card know what these numbers mean. This program
	has been set up so that the numbers are in 3 groups of 6 numbers. Each groups
	defines one corner of the triangle. The number are in the format x, y, z, r, g, b
	where x, y and z are the position of the corner in 3D space, and r, g and b are 
	the red, green and blue channels that define the colour of the point.</p>
