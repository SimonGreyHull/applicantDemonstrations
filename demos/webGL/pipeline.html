    <h1>The Graphics Pipeline</h1>
    <p>In graphics there are very many independent calculations going on to create a scene.</p>
	<p>Often, the computer is doing the same calculations with different bits of data. For example, all the points (or vertices) that 
	make up a model could be moved to the right place in a 3D scene, or all the pixels that make up a triangle could be coloured using the same lighting model.</p>
	<p>It doesn't matter which calculations are done first. They could be done in any order, or they could be done <b>all at the same time</b></p>
    <p>This is how your graphics hardware works. It can perform the same calculations on thousands of different bits of data at the same time.</p>
	<p>Today we're going to look at three parts of the process. They are:</p>
	<p>1. Loading data into graphics buffers.</p>
	<p>2. Moving vertices around in 3D space.</p>
	<p>3. Calculating what colour individual pixels should be.</p>
