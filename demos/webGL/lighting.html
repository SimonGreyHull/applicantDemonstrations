    <h1>Let There Be Light!</h1>
<p>After the vertex shader the newly transformed vertices are group into triangles, and 
sent to the rasterizer, which splits the triangles into pixels. Then, for every pixel in the
scene the pixel shader is run. Again, this process is run for thousands of pixels at the same time.</p>
<p>Here the program has been set up so that we know the normal vector for each pixel. The normal
vector is a vector that points straight out of the surface. At the moment this vector is being used
to colour the model, but we're going to adapt the pixel shader to add some moody lighting to the scene.</p>
	<h2>Try it yourself!</h2>
	<img src="assets/cogs.png"/><p>Change the line that says:</p>
	<p>gl_FragColor = vec4(v_normal * 0.5 + 0.5, 1.0);</p>
	<p>to</p>
	<pre>vec3 lightDirection = vec3(1,0,0);
float diff = max(dot(v_normal, normalize(lightDirection)), 0.0);
gl_FragColor = vec4(diff, diff, diff, 1.0);</pre>
	<p>then click update.</p>
	<p>Experiment by changing the lightDirection to different sets of three numbers.</p>
